	<h1>Presets</h1>
	<pre>
	The presets are really easy to use. All you gotta do is click on one and "Start".
	The only difference is toast, which will be covered later on.
	</pre>

	<h1>Toasting and Selecting</h1>
	<pre>
	When you select toast, 3 more buttons will appear. By default, "Golden" is always 
	selected as your first option. You can then choose how you want your toast. The details
	of each selected will be displayed on the display in the middle of the toaster oven.
	When selected your choice, press start to begin the process.
	</pre>

	<h1>Set up Timer and Temp</h1>
	<pre>
	To set up your timer and/or temp, press the "Timer" or "Temp" button. When you select one,
	you will then see the numbers on the display. The buttons above and below the display controls 
	that specific digit placement of that number. This works for both time and temp. After you are happy
	with the time and temp, you press start to begin. You can press stop to cancel anytime. 
	</pre>

	<h1>Top Features!</h1>
	<pre>
	On the top of the toaster oven, there are a few features you can use. 

	1)Power Button
		The "PWR" or power button is kinda obvious. The toaster will not run when that button is off. 
		When the oven is on, the button will change to the color green. 
	2)Lock Button
		The lock button will lock the screen so that nothing else can be used until the button is pressed
		again. The picture will indicate the status of the lock screen as well as the button itself will
		turn yellow when it is in lock mode.
	3)Sound Button
		This toaster oven has sounds. Specificlly when the power is turned on or off, and when the timer is finished.
		This buton can mute all sounds so that nothing can be heard. The picture will change depending on if the toaster
		oven is muted or not. Like the lock button, the button itself will change to yellow to indicate that it is in 
		mute mode. 
	4)Incogonito Button
		This button will remove all the boxes that are not part of this list but the text will remain the same. The display
		will be uneffected. This is to give it a more cleaner look and to see what youre toasting.
