	<h1>Why is this a good interface?</h1>
	<pre>
	I feel this interface is good because it looks really basic. It still has parts of an original toaster oven
	but with a more modern twist. The buttons are self-explanatory and the usage is easy to figure out. 
	Especially with the additional feature to hide most of the UI, allows it for a much more cleaner look. 
	There are also other options such as how well you want to toast your bread that will appear but later,
	disappear once it begins, to again remove any clutter on the UI. The buttons above and below the display allows
	for a faster way to set time/temp.
