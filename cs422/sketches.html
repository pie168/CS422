<h1>Presets</h1>
	<img src="Presets.jpg" style="width:200px;height: 300px;">
	
	<pre>
	Here we have 4 presets that the user can choose from. Toast will allow the user
	to toast their bread. Selecting this will open 3 more buttons that will ask how 
	well you want your bread toasted. The following are the options for toast:
		1)Golden
		2)Crispy
		3)Burnt
	When you click on any of the preset button, the display in the middle will show you
	information regarding that preset such as time and temp.
	</pre>
	<h1>Body</h1>
	<img src="Body.jpg" style="width:400px;height: 250px;">

	<pre>
	The body of the toaster oven consist of the display and a few buttons on both 
	the top and bottom. The display will give out information such as the time and temp.
	When changing the time or temp, the numbers will be aligned so that the buttons on the 
	top and bottom will allow you to change those specific digits.  
	</pre>
	<h1>Switches</h1>
	<img src="Switches.jpg" style="width:200px;height: 300px;">

	<pre>
	Here we have the options to set the temp, time, and converstion of temp. We also have a
	start and stop button for obvious reasons. 
	</pre>
	<h1>Options</h1>
	<img src="Options.jpg" style="width:400px;height: 250px;">

	<pre>
	The top buttons allow the user to use some extra features. The following: 
		1)Lock Button
			This locks the entire screen so after you start the toaster oven, you can't press 
			anything else other than to unlock the screen. This is to prevent any accidental 
			presses.
		2)Sound Button
			A feature this toaster oven has is that it plays sounds. During the event that you
			want a quiet setting, this will allow you to mute your toaster oven to prevent it from
			making any noise.
		3)Incognito Button
			This button hides most of the UI except the display to give you a less cluttered view on 
			what ever you're cooking.
